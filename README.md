## ⚡ What is this?

**Code no Jutsu** is my personal dojo of bite-sized projects — a collection of small but creative scripts and ideas that spark joy, curiosity, or mischief. They're fast, funky, and sometimes just for laughs.

Think of this as:
- 🧠 Brain warm-ups  
- 🧪 Rapid-fire experiments  
- 🎨 Creative coding doodles  
- 🔥 Tiny tools with unexpected energy  

> Inspired by anime vibes.

## 🧰 Tech & Themes

- 🐍 **Python** (core)
- ⚔️ **Streamlit / Flask** (for ninja UIs)
- 🖼️ **PIL / OpenCV / Matplotlib** (visual trickery)
- 🔊 **Music tools** (because every shinobi needs rhythm)
- 🎮 **Game-inspired hacks**
- 💻 **Terminal tools and automation**

## 🥷 Why the Name?

> *"no Jutsu"* (の術) means “technique” in Japanese.  
> Every snippet here is a new coding jutsu — short, sharp, and full of creative chakra.

We’re just programmers casting spells on logic.
