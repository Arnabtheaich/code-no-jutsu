## ⚡ What is this?

**Code no Jutsu** is a personal micro-project repository where I regularly contribute small, fun, and experimental Python (or other language) code snippets. These aren’t full-blown apps — they’re fast, funky, and sometimes just for laughs.

Think of this as:
- 🧠 Brain warm-ups
- 🧪 Rapid experiments
- 🎨 Creative coding doodles
- 🔥 Mini tools with big energy

## 🧰 Technologies & Themes

- 🐍 Python (main language)
- 📦 Streamlit / Flask (for mini web UIs)
- 🖼️ PIL / OpenCV / Matplotlib (image & plot fun)
- 💻 Shell & automation scripts
- 🎵 Beat & music-related code
- 🎮 Game-inspired scripts
- 📜 Poetic or lyrical logic challenges
- 🎙️ Hiphop-coded expressions
