# Random Ninja Name Generator

**Jutsu Level:** Beginner

**Description:**  
A simple Python script that randomly combines an adjective and a noun from predefined lists to create a fun ninja name like "Silent Shadow" or "Swift Tiger".

**Jutsu Scroll (What I learned / Challenges):**  
Practiced working with lists, the `random` module, and string formatting. Also learned how to structure code with a main guard (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) for script execution. No major challenges but thinking of cool ninja-themed words was fun!
